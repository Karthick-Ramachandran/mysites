I started this year (2019) with a lot of expectations in my mind, thinking about my career in programming, My English fluency, Thinking bad about the past (My college grades), and my relationship status.

It's really frustrating when you need to ask for money from your parents or friends regardless of working as a software developer. If you're not good enough in what you're doing, <b>You should quit</b>.

The above point doesn't mean you need to be a prodigy at coding (that applies to all the fields), As long as you enjoy what you're doing, Push yourself to get better at what you're doing. <b>Never Give up</b>.

Not all the talented, Down to earth people need to start a company, Talented people can work for others to make the impact they want to create.

It's almost impossible to build a perfect B2B product without good industry experience.

Freelancing in web and mobile app development is already ruined.

If you want yourself to look like a better developer than others, You have two options

- Carry this anxiety for the rest of your life.
- Enjoy the ends with a smile and tea with your best friend.

Choosing one is hard.

Some people think me as a nerd, Some people who know me long before won't accept the position of where I'm now. The point is <b>You don't need to care.</b>

You should take care of all the problems you face by yourself. Never expect magic to happen.

<b> Say no when you're not excited. Say no when you don't have time.</b>

Understand what you're doing.

Communication is very important when working with teams.

When you see a lot of work to be done in a week. A better message is "I can't do it this week". Don't say I'll try to finish this week.

Don't fall into a relationship trap if you're struggling to join the ends (Personal opinion).

A relationship might make a man noble if it comes to the right person at the right time.

Choosing a life partner isn't easy. It's more like a beginner choosing a JavaScript framework.

Not everyone can get a six-figure salary very early. Even though it is possible in programming, Most people need time to get there eventually.

Even freshers from reputed universities can give you imposter syndrome. Carrying imposter syndrome makes no sense.

If you want to be an exceptional programmer, You should be good at algorithms and data structures.

When you're in an argument, Speak with facts to justify what you're saying.

Don't say college degrees are not important to a student who is currently pursuing a college degree.

A college degree is good, but it's not everything you need to succeed. Having a college degree will surely help, but you need to know what you want to do.

Choose what works best for you. You should take serious attention when deciding the following

- Career
- Time management
- Relationship

Always look for opportunity to climb up. No matter what you're doing, You'll be learning something each day and take notes of it.

Give importance to people who wants to talk to you. Don't care about the people who ignores you.
